+I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits
+
+For me, the first challenge for computing science is to discover
+how to maintain order in a finite, but very large, discrete universe
+that is intricately intertwined. And a second, but not less important
+challenge is how to mould what you have achieved in solving the first
+problem, into a teachable discipline: it does not suffice to hone your
+own intellect (that will join you in your grave), you must teach others
+how to hone theirs. The more you concentrate on these two challenges,
+the clearer you will see that they are only two sides of the same coin:
+teaching yourself is discovering what is teachable.
+
+Three virtues of a programmer
+
+- Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce
+overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs
+that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you
+don't have to answer so many questions about it.
+
+- Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This
+makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but
+actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.
+
+- Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that
+other people won't want to say bad things about.
+
