## Object Orienting Design

Industry standard OO It's not OO

Data do not perfectly represent a real world object

Data has to be used in many more inter relational ways than OO pretends

When you hide your data behind a class you are force to re implement
basic things that are already available to the language.

The only patter that should arise from looking at your  source code is patterns
of your domain.

OO is really bad for concurrency
